# Testing Toolkit

> Please note this is work in progress repo for GCP

üèó A set of CLIs, tools and tests to set up, manage and operate Polygon devnets.

The **Testing Toolkit** is built on top of `express-cli`, an extension of `matic-cli` which uses `terraform` to deploy,
test and monitor any devnet on GCP from any local system.

It currently supports **only** devnets running `v0.3.x` stacks.

The `express-cli` interacts with `terraform` to create a fully working setup on GCP.  
This setup is composed by a set of `GCP Compute` instances running a specific `ubuntu 22.04 images`,
and a `public-subnet` with its `VPC`.  
In case the infrastructure already exists, `matic-cli` can be used as a standalone tool to deploy Polygon stacks on
pre-configured VMs.

Please, refer to the section of this file you are more interested in (`express-cli` or `matic-cli`)

## `express-cli`

### TODO

- [x] Convert the terraform and node js scripts to work with GCP infra
- [x] Check most of the express cli commands are working
- [ ] Work with multiple devnets at the same time
- [ ] Test with dockerized == 'yes'
- [ ] Test with enabling archival node
- [ ] Test with adding PD (currently it tested with boot disk)
- [ ] Enable datadog integration
- [ ] More validations
- [ ] Test with more GCP machine types

### Requirements

To use the `express-cli` you have to execute the following steps.

- [install gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [install terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) on your local machine
- use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to switch to the proper `node` version, `v16.17.1`,
  by running `nvm use` from the root folder
- install `express-cli` and `matic-cli` locally with command `npm i`
- generate a keypair locally (`.pem` and `.pem.pub` files) using `ssh-keygen`
- copy `secret.tfvars.example` to `secret.tfvar` with command `cp secret.tfvars.example secret.tfvars` and check the commented file for details
- **If you are a Polygon employee**, connect to the company VPN
- modify `secret.tfvar` with addresses of the allowed IPs (as specified in `secret.tfvars.example` file)
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` with command `cp .env.example .env` and check the heavily commented file for details
- make sure `PEM_FILE_PATH` points to a correct key certificate, the one you downloaded in the previous steps
- define the number of nodes (`TF_VAR_VALIDATOR_COUNT` and `TF_VAR_SENTRY_COUNT`) and adjust the `DEVNET_BOR_USERS`
  accordingly
- use `TF_VAR_DOCKERZIED=no` to have one VM per node, otherwise the stack will run on one VM only in a dockerized environment
- (optional) replace `TF_VAR_VM_NAME` with your own identifier (it can be any string, default is "polygon-user")
- (optional) replace `TF_VAR_DISK_SIZE_GB` with your preferred disk size in GB (default is 100 GB)
- `VERBOSE=true` prints logs from the remote machines. If set to `false`, only `express-cli` and `matic-cli` logs will
  be shown
- **If you are a Polygon employee**, please refer to [this page](https://www.notion.so/polygontechnology/Testing-Toolkit-d47e098641d14c80b2e9a90b3b1b88d9) for more info

### Auth Configuration

As a prerequisite, you need to configure authentication on `gcloud`.

If you have downloaded the service account credentials, uou can use the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to provide the location of thst credential JSON file. 

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login

# OR

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/absolute/path/to/sa/creds.json'
```

### Commands

Instructions to run `express-cli`.
For the list of commands, please run `express-cli --help`
First off, you need to `--init` terraform on your local machine, by executing the following command.

- `./bin/express-cli --init`

  - Initializes a new devnet folder with terraform and creates some git-ignored files locally. This step is mandatory
    before running any other command. The new devnet folder created will be `devnet-<id>` where `id` is a monotonically
    increasing count for the devnets. Once created, you can `cd deployments/devnet-<id>` and run the other commands.
    This allows you to work with multiple devnets at once.
    Then, a remote devnet can be created with the `--start` command, as follows.

- `../../bin/express-cli --start`

  - Creates the desired remote setup, based on the preferences defined in the `.env.devnet<id>` file
  - `--start` command can be used also to target an existing GCO setup. If changes to `.env.devnet<id>` file are detected, the
    previous devnet will be destroyed and a new one created, reusing the same GCP VMs  
     To destroy the remote devnet, you can execute the `--destroy` command.

- `../../bin/express-cli --destroy`

  - Destroys the remote setup and delete the dedicated VMs

The `express-cli` also comes with additional utility commands, listed below. Some of them are only available for non-dockerized devnets.

- `../../bin/express-cli --update-all [index]`

  - Fetches `heimdall` and `bor` branches defined as `HEIMDALL_BRANCH` and `BOR_BRANCH` in `.env.devnet<id>` file,
    pulls relative changes and restarts those services on the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be
    performed only on the VM corresponding to that index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --update-bor [index]`

  - Fetches `bor` branch defined as `BOR_BRANCH` in `.env.devnet<id>` file, pulls relative changes and restarts it on
    the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be performed only on the VM corresponding to that index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --update-heimdall [index]`

  - Fetches `heimdall` branch defined as `HEIMDALL_BRANCH` in `.env.devnet<id>` file, pulls relative changes and restarts it on
    the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be performed only on the VM corresponding to that
    index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --restart-all [index]`

  - Restarts `bor` and `heimdall` on all the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be performed
    only on the VM corresponding to that index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --restart-bor [index]`

  - Restarts `bor` on all the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be performed only on the VM
    corresponding to that index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --restart-heimdall [index]`

  - Restarts `heimdall` on all the remote machines. If an integer `index` is used, the job will be performed only on
    the VM corresponding to that index.

- `../../bin/express-cli --cleanup`

  - Cleans up `ganache`, `bor`, `heimdall` and `bridge`, redeploys all the contracts and restarts all the services
    The `express-cli` also provides additional testing commands, listed here.

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-state-sync`

  - Create a `state-sync` transaction on the remote network

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-staked-event`

  - Create a `Staked` transaction on the remote network and adds a new validator.

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-stakeupdate-event`

  - Create a `StakeUpdate` transaction on the remote network and increase stake of 1st validator by 100 MATIC.

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-signerchange-event`

  - Create a `SignerChange` transaction on the remote network and changes the signer of the 1st validator.

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-topupfee-event`

  - Create a `TopUpFee` transaction on the remote network and adds balance/heimdallFee for the first validator on Heimdall.

- `../../bin/express-cli --send-unstakeinit-event [validatorID]`

  - Create a `UnstakeInit` transaction on the remote network and removes the validator from validator-set. `validatorID` can be used to specify the validator to be removed. If not specified, the first validator will be removed.

- ` ../../bin/express-cli --monitor [exit]`

  - Monitors the reception of state-syncs and checkpoints to make sure the whole network is in a healthy state.
    If `--send-state-sync` hasn't been used before, only checkpoints will be detected. Monitor the setup.  
    If `exit` string is passed the process terminates when at least one `stateSync` and one `checkpoint` are detected.

- ` ../../bin/express-cli --instances-stop`

  - Stop the GCP compute VM instances associated with the deployed devnet.

- ` ../../bin/express-cli --instances-start`

  - Start the (previously stopped) GCP compute instances associated with the deployed devnet. Also, it starts all services, such as ganache, heimdall, and bor

- `../../bin/express-cli --stress [fund]`

  - Runs the stress tests on remote nodes. The string `fund` is needed when stress tests are ran for the first time,
    to fund the accounts

- `../../bin/express-cli --setup-datadog`

  - Sets up datadog on the nodes and gets them ready to send metrics to Datadog Dashboard. `DD_API_KEY` env var is required for this.

- `../../bin/express-cli --chaos [intensity]`

  - Adds dedicated chaos(de-peering) to the network. The `intensity` parameter is optional and can be set from `1` to `10`. If not set, `5` is used.

- `../../bin/express-cli --rewind [numberOfBlocks]`

  - Rewinds the chain by a defined number of blocks (not greater than `128`). Default `numberOfBlocks` value is `100`.

- `../../bin/express-cli --eip-1559-test [index]`
  - Executes a test to send EIP 1559 tx. In case of a non-dockerized devnet, if an integer [index] is specified, it will use
    that VM to send the tx. Otherwise, it will target the first VM.

## `matic-cli`

`matic-cli` has to be installed on a `ubuntu` VM (_host_) and - through a config file - it will point to
other VMs' IPs (_remotes_).

- Host machine will run a Polygon node (`bor` and `heimdall`) and a layer 1 node (`ganache`)
- Remote machines will only run a Polygon node each

### Requirements

Please, make sure to install the following software/packages on the VMs.

- Build Essentials (_host_ and _remotes_)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential
  ```

- Go 1.18+ (_host_ and _remotes_)

  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible/master/go-install.sh
  bash go-install.sh --remove
  bash go-install.sh
  ```

- Rabbitmq (_host_ and _remotes_)

  ```bash
  sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
  ```

- Docker (_host_ and _remotes_, only needed in case of a docker setup)

  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

- Node v16.17.1 (only _host_)

  ```bash
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
  nvm install 16.17.1
  ```

- Npm (only _host_)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs npm
  ```

- Python 2 (only _host_)

  ```bash
  sudo apt install python2 && alias python="/usr/bin/python2
  ```

- Solc v0.5.16 (only _host_)

  ```bash
  sudo snap install solc
  ```

- Ganache CLI (only _host_)
  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g ganache
  ```

### Usage

On the _host_ machine, please run

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic-cli.git
cd matic-cli
npm i
mkdir devnet
cd devnet
```

#### Local dockerized network

Adjust the [docker configs](configs/devnet/docker-setup-config.yaml) and run

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -c ../configs/devnet/docker-setup-config.yaml
```

Once the setup is done, follow these steps for local docker deployment

- Move to devnet folder
  ```bash
  cd matic-cli/devnet
  ```
- Start ganache

  ```bash
  bash docker-ganache-start.sh
  ```

- Start `heimdall` instances (it will run all services - rabbitmq, heimdall, bridge, server)

  ```bash
  bash docker-heimdall-start-all.sh
  ```

- Setup `bor`

  ```bash
  bash docker-bor-setup.sh
  ```

- Start bor

  ```bash
  bash docker-bor-start-all.sh
  ```

- Deploy contracts on Child chain

  ```bash
  bash ganache-deployment-bor.sh
  ```

- Sync contract addresses to Main chain
  ```bash
  bash ganache-deployment-sync.sh
  ```

Logs will be stored under `logs/` folder

Note: in case of docker setup, we have provided [some additional scripts](src/setup/devnet/templates/docker/README.md) which might be helpful.

#### Remote network

Adjust the [remote configs](configs/devnet/remote-setup-config.yaml) and run

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -c ../configs/devnet/remote-setup-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, this step can be executed interactively with

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -i
```

Once the setup is done, follow these steps for remote deployment  
In this case, the stack is already running, you would just need to deploy/sync some contracts, as follows:

- Move to devnet folder
  ```bash
  cd matic-cli/devnet
  ```
- Deploy contracts on Child chain

  ```bash
  bash ganache-deployment-bor.sh
  ```

- Sync contract addresses to Main chain
  ```bash
  bash ganache-deployment-sync.sh
  ```

#### Clean setup

Stop al services, remove the `matic-cli/devnet` folder, and you can start the process once again

#### Notes

1. The ganache URL hostname will be used for ganache `http://<host-machine-ip>:9545`
2. Make sure that the _host_ machine has access to remote machines for transferring the data
   To persist ssh key for remote access, please run:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add `<.pem file>`
   ```
3. We have provided the default config values [here](configs/devnet) to ensure smooth functioning of the process  
   Please check the relative [README](configs/README.md) for more accurate description of such configs
   These files are used as templates and dynamically modified by `express-cli`, hence they should not be deleted nor any modification remotely pushed
   Therefore, they are under `.gitignore`, and in case you do not want those changes to be reflected in your local `git`,
   you can use the commands

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged configs/devnet/remote-setup-config.yaml
git update-index --assume-unchanged configs/devnet/docker-setup-config.yaml
```

to undo, please use

```bash
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged configs/devnet/remote-setup-config.yaml
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged configs/devnet/docker-setup-config.yaml
```
